    <h1>Burnt Basque Cheesecake</h1>

    <!-- Recipe Description -->
    <p>
        This is the iconic Burnt Basque Cheesecake, in all its rustic perfection with the signature golden "burnt" surface that tastes like caramel, and light-as-air creamy vanilla cheesecake inside. Stunningly luscious yet light, and not that sweet at all!
    </p>
    <p>
        The surface becomes golden by baking at a higher temp than classic baked cheesecakes â€“ 160Â°C/320Â°F vs 220Â°C/425Â°F for Basque.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe is not a basic "dump and beat" recipe, but the result is better. Texture is fluffier, as it should be, with no thick band of dry overcooked cheesecake (notorious problem!). Use a handheld electric beater or stand mixer with the paddle attachment. See Note 5 about speeds.

        <li>750 g / 1.5 lb cream cheese blocks, room temperature (I use Philadelphia, Note 1)</li>
        <li>1 cup caster / superfine sugar (regular white sugar ok too)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whipping cream, take out of fridge 15 minutes prior (Note 2)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour, plain/all-purpose</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean extract or paste</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Shorthand Recipe (for experienced bakers)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep</strong> â€“ Preheat oven to 220Â°C / 425Â°F (200Â°C fan) with the shelf in the middle. Press scrunched paper into 20cm/8" springform pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Batter</strong> â€“ Beat cream cheese 2 minutes on medium. Beat in sugar on low speed for 10 seconds. In a separate bowl, hand whisk 1/4 cup cream with the flour (becomes like paste). Whisk in remaining cream and vanilla. While beating on low, slowly pour cream into cream cheese, then eggs (don't overbeat).</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> â€“ Pour into pan, bang pan on counter, pop bubbles with knife. Bake 45 min (up to 65 min possible, Note 8) until top deep golden. Cool 2 hrs on counter then 8 hrs+ in fridge uncovered. Ready for serving!</li>

    <h3>Full Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220Â°C / 425Â°F (200Â°C fan) with the shelf in the middle of the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Pan prep (Note 4)</strong> â€“ Press 2 x 40cm/16" sheets of scrunched-up baking/parchment paper arranged in an "X" into a 20cm/8" springform pan (6cm / 2.5" tall), and fold down over the rim to hold in place. You'll need to scrunch/pleat to fit which creates the signature rustic sides! The batter will weigh it down so don't worry if it doesn't stay in.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until smooth and lump-free. Add sugar and beat on low speed for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour & cream (Note 6)</strong> â€“ Put about 1/4 of the cream and all the flour in a medium bowl. Hand whisk until lump-free (it will be paste-like), then slowly pour in the remaining cream while whisking. Once flour is incorporated, whisk in vanilla. (PS not making whipped cream here! Should be pourable)</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the cream into the cream cheese bowl with the beater going on low. Beat just until combined. Then slowly pour the eggs in while the beater is still on low speed. As soon as the eggs are incorporated, stop beating to minimise getting bubbles in the batter (Note 7).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove air bubbles</strong> â€“ Pour into the prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter then pop bubbles that rise to the surface with a small sharp knife. I do repeat 3 to 5 times. (Note 7)</li>
        <li>Bake 45 minutes or until the surface is a deep golden brown. It can take up to 65 minutes and that's fine! (Seriously, read Note 8) Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes, you want it deeply golden but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflÃ©.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill overnight</strong> â€“ Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink, that's normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, uncovered.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving</strong> â€“ Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides â€“ I love serving it on the paper, it's part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits, though also great served chilled. Cut like cake! Eat as is â€“ doesn't need cream, berries etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Recipe Notes -->
    <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Cream cheese</strong> â€“ 3 x 250g/8oz blocks. Philadelphia is my go-to, but we made this with a variety of brands (including most economical) and it still worked great. Tub spreadable cream cheese also works, albeit the inside is marginally more creamy (some would find it even more appealing!) But DO NOT USE LOW FAT! Wonâ€™t set properly.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Whipping cream</strong> â€“ Make sure you use cream that can be whipped. Not all creams are. Read the label. ðŸ™‚ And again, NO LOW FAT! ðŸ™‚ Taking it out of the fridge prior to use is to de-chill slightly so it incorporates better with the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Measuring the eggs</strong> â€“ Yes, I really need you to measure the eggs for this recipe, because selfish chickens just wonâ€™t lay the same size eggs every time. I rarely ask this in cakes â€“ only when it matters! (PS Eggs are slightly lighter than water so 220g eggs = 200 ml).</li>
        <li><strong>4. Pan & lining</strong> â€“ Donâ€™t get too hung up about the paper, the batter will weigh it down. Scrunch paper in your fist, makes it easier to fit into pan and you get the signature nubbly sides. Fit into corners as best you can â€“ sometimes I use cans to mould in while I make filling. Also prevents side from overcooking (because side is not in full contact with pan). Donâ€™t grease the pan â€“ conducts heat and the sides will get too brown. No springform pan? Itâ€™s ok, just use a slightly larger paper so you can lift the cake out of your regular 20cm/8â€³ cake pan (6cm / 2.5â€³ high).</li>
        <li><strong>5. Beater speeds</strong>: Low = lowest speed, medium = halfway (eg speed 5 of 10), medium high = 3/4 of the way (eg speed7 of 10).</li>
        <li><strong>6. Cream & flour</strong> â€“ Be careful not to pour in too much cream at the beginning else youâ€™ll get pesky flour lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Air bubbles in batter</strong> = browned lumps on surface of cooked cake. Itâ€™s just a visual thing, totally not a big deal. Almost always have some bubbles on the surface ðŸ™‚</li>
        <li><strong>8. Baking time</strong> â€“ Go by surface colour to tell when itâ€™s done. The bake time differs from 45 minutes to 65 minutes depending on oven brands. Mine is a Miele (45 min), JBâ€˜s Westinghouse takes 65 min. End result is the same, both surface colour and creaminess of inside. Itâ€™s extraordinary! We tested this quite extensively because we found it hard to believe ourselves. ðŸ™‚</li>
        <li><strong>9. Leftovers</strong> will keep for 5 days in the fridge. Flavour gets even better on Day 2 and beyond! Not suitable for freezing.</li>
